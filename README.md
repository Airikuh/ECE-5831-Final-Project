The purpose of this final project is to explore and compare 3 methods of machine learning. The 3 methods discussed will be K-Means clustering, Logistic Regression and Neural Networks. All 3 of these methods will be applied to the same data set consisting of 150 data samples of 3 different Iris flower species. Each sample consists of the measurements of the width and length of the petal and sepal of all 150 flowers. These measurements will be used as the features by which to apply a machine learning algorithm. The output of these models will be a prediction of the species of the Iris flower. The data set of 150 Iris flowers will be used for both model training and validation in k-means clustering, logistic regression and neural network machine learning methods.
